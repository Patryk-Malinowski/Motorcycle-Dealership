# Motorcycle-Dealership

2nd Year motorcycle dealership project. Everything is saved to ArrayLists. The system allows the user to manage stock, customer details and orders using a neat interface. The interactive menu allows the user to: 

0. Exit
1. Check All Stock
2. Add Stock
3. Remove Stock
4. Add Customer
5. Remove Customer
6. Display Customer Info
7. Display All Customer Id's
8. Create Order
9. Delete Order

The system has simple safeguards (including appropriate messages/outputs) preventing creating an order for an already ordered motorcycle, requiring appropriate inputs for details of motorycles and customers, requiring appropriate inputs navigating the menu.
